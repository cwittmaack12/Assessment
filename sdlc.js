const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysis = "aAl activities, which help the transformation of requirement specification into implementation."

const design = "the process by which an agent creates a specification of a software artifact intended to accomplish goals, using a set of primitive components and subject to constraints."

const testingAndIntegration = "a type of software testing in which the different units, modules or components of a software application are tested as a combined entity"

const implementation = "installing a new hardware or software system or application."

const maintain = "the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs."
